Q. What is Visual Studio?
It is a powerful developer tool that you can use to complete the entire development cycle in one place. It's a comprehensive integrated development environment (IDE) that you can use to write, edit, debug, and build code. Then deploy your app. 

Q. Why to use VS over others?
Visual Studio includes compilers, code completion tools, source control, extensions, and many other features to enhance every stage of the software development process.
	--> Workload-based installer - install only what you need
	Powerful coding tools and features - everything you need to build your apps in one place
	Multiple language support - code in C++, C#, JavaScript, TypeScript, Python, and more
	Cross-platform development - build apps for any platform
	Version control integration - collaborate on code with team mates
	AI-assisted development - write code more efficiently with AI assistance

Q. Hot Reload
	Use it to fix issues or make changes to the code on the fly and see the results without restarting the app.

Q. Coding Standards in C#
	1. Use language keywords for datatypes instead of the runtime types. For example, use string instead of System.String
	2. 'var' keyword is used to declare implicit type variables in C#, which means it tells the compiler to figure out the variable type at compilation time. A var variable must be initialized at the time of declaration. ​​var can contain any type of data.
	-- Interface names start with a capital I.
	-- Use "PascalCasing" when naming a class, interface, struct, or delegate type, constant names, both fields and local constants
	-- Use camelCase for method parameters and local variables.
	-- Private instance fields start with an underscore (_) and the remaining text is camelCased.
	-- Static fields start with s_
